## Day 05 — Earth 🌍

For the Earth theme, I built an interactive 3D globe visualizing the [RESOLVE Ecoregions Dataset (2017) dataset](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/RESOLVE_ECOREGIONS_2017).  
I converted the source shapefiles into vector tiles (Mapbox Tilesets) and rendered them using Mapbox GL JS’s globe projection. Each region is styled by biome, with hover interactions to explore ecosystems across the planet.
